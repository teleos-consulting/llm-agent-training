Julius Caesar (play)

The  Tragedy  of  Julius  Caesar  (First  Folio  title:  The
Tragedie of Ivlivs Cæsar), often shortened to Julius Caesar,
is  a  history  play  and  tragedy  by  William  Shakespeare  first
performed in 1599.

In the play, Brutus joins a conspiracy led by Cassius to assassinate
Julius  Caesar,  to  prevent  him  from  becoming  a  tyrant.  Caesar's
right-hand man Antony stirs up hostility against the conspirators
and Rome becomes embroiled in a dramatic civil war.

Synopsis

The play opens with two tribunes Flavius and Marullus (appointed
leaders/officials  of  Rome)  discovering  the  commoners  of  Rome
celebrating  Julius  Caesar's  triumphant  return  from  defeating  the
sons  of  his  military  rival,  Pompey.  The  tribunes,  insulting  the
crowd for their change in loyalty from Pompey to Caesar, attempt
to end the festivities and break up the commoners, who return the
insults. During the feast of Lupercal, Caesar holds a victory parade
and a soothsayer warns him to "Beware the ides of March," which
he  ignores.  Meanwhile,  Cassius  attempts  to  convince  Brutus  to
join his conspiracy to kill Caesar. Although Brutus, friendly towards Caesar, is hesitant to kill him, he
agrees  that  Caesar  may  be  abusing  his  power.  They  then  hear  from  Casca  that  Mark  Antony  has
offered Caesar the crown of Rome three times. Casca tells them that each time Caesar refused it with
increasing  reluctance,  hoping  that  the  crowd  watching  would  insist  that  he  accept  the  crown.  He
describes how the crowd applauded Caesar for denying the crown, and how this upset Caesar. On the
eve  of  the  ides  of  March,  the  conspirators  meet  and  reveal  that  they  have  forged  letters  of  support
from the Roman people to tempt Brutus into joining. Brutus reads the letters and, after much moral
debate,  decides  to  join  the  conspiracy,  thinking  that  Caesar  should  be  killed  to  prevent  him  from
doing anything against the people of Rome if he were ever to be crowned.

Ghost of Caesar, Julius Caesar, Act
IV, Scene III, a 1905 portrait by
Edwin Austin Abbey

After  ignoring  the  soothsayer,  as  well  as  his  wife  Calpurnia's  own  premonitions,  Caesar  goes  to  the
Senate. The conspirators approach him with a fake petition pleading on behalf of Metellus Cimber's
banished brother. As Caesar predictably rejects the petition, Casca and the others suddenly stab him;
Brutus is last. At this, Caesar asks "Et tu, Brute?"[1] ("And you, Brutus?"), concluding with "Then fall,
Caesar!"

The  conspirators  attempt  to  demonstrate  that  they  killed  Caesar
for  the  good  of  Rome,  to  prevent  an  autocrat.  They  prove  this  by
not  attempting  to  flee  the  scene.  Brutus  delivers  an  oration
defending  his  actions,  and  for  the  moment,  the  crowd  is  on  his
side.  However,  Antony  makes  a  subtle  and  eloquent  speech  over
Caesar's  corpse,  beginning  "Friends,  Romans,  countrymen,  lend
me  your  ears!"[2]  He  deftly  turns  public  opinion  against  the
assassins by manipulating the emotions of the common people, in
contrast  to  the  rational  tone  of  Brutus's  speech,  yet  there  is  a
method in his rhetorical speech and gestures. Antony reminds the
crowd of the good Caesar had done for Rome, his sympathy with
the  poor,  and  his  refusal  of  the  crown  at  the  Lupercal,  thus
questioning Brutus's claim of Caesar's ambition; he shows Caesar's
bloody, lifeless body to the crowd to have them shed tears and gain
sympathy for their fallen hero; and he reads Caesar's will, in which
every Roman citizen would receive 75 drachmas. Antony, even as
he  states  his  intentions  against  it,  rouses  the  mob  to  drive  the
conspirators  from  Rome.  Amid  the  violence,  an  innocent  poet,
Cinna, is confused with the conspirator Lucius Cinna and is taken
by the mob, which kills him for such "offences" as his bad verses.

Brutus then attacks Cassius for supposedly soiling the noble act of
regicide by having accepted bribes. ("Did not great Julius bleed for
justice' sake? / What villain touched his body, that did stab, / And
not for justice?"[3]) The two are reconciled, especially after Brutus
reveals that his beloved wife committed suicide under the stress of
his  absence  from  Rome;  they  prepare  for  a  civil  war  against
Antony,  Caesar's  adopted  son  Octavius,  and  Lepidus  who  have
formed a triumvirate in Rome. That night, Caesar's ghost appears
to  Brutus  with  a  warning  of  defeat.  (He  informs  Brutus,  "Thou
shalt see me at Philippi."[4])

At the Battle of Philippi, Cassius and Brutus, knowing that they will probably both die, smile their last
smiles to each other and hold hands. During the battle, Cassius has his servant kill him after hearing
of the capture of his best friend, Titinius. After Titinius, who was not captured, sees Cassius's corpse,
he  commits  suicide.  However,  Brutus  wins  that  stage  of  the  battle,  but  his  victory  is  not  conclusive.
With a heavy heart, Brutus battles again the next day. He asks his friends to kill him, but the friends
refuse. He loses and commits suicide by running on his sword, held for him by a loyal soldier.

The  play  ends  with  a  tribute  to  Brutus  by  Antony,  who  proclaims  that  Brutus  has  remained  "the
noblest  Roman  of  them  all"[5]  because  he  was  the  only  conspirator  who  acted,  in  his  mind,  for  the
good  of  Rome.  There  is  then  a  small  hint  at  the  friction  between  Antony  and  Octavius  which
characterizes another of Shakespeare's Roman plays, Antony and Cleopatra.

Sources

Antony (George Coulouris) kneels over

conclusion of the Mercury Theatre
production of Caesar (1937–38)

The main source of the play is Thomas North's translation of Plutarch's Lives.[7][8]

Deviations from Plutarch

Shakespeare makes Caesar's triumph take place on the day of Lupercalia (15 February) instead
of six months earlier.
For dramatic effect, he makes the Capitol the venue of Caesar's death rather than the Curia
Pompeia (Curia of Pompey).
Caesar's murder, the funeral, Antony's oration, the reading of the will, and the arrival of Octavius
all take place on the same day in the play. However, historically, the assassination took place on
15 March (The Ides of March), the will was published on 18 March, the funeral was on 20 March,
and Octavius arrived only in May.
Shakespeare makes the Triumvirs meet in Rome instead of near Bononia to avoid an additional
locale.
He combines the two Battles of Philippi although there was a 20-day interval between them.
Shakespeare has Caesar say Et tu, Brute? ("And you, Brutus?") before he dies. Plutarch and
Suetonius each report that he said nothing, with Plutarch adding that he pulled his toga over his
head when he saw Brutus among the conspirators,[9] though Suetonius does record other reports
that Caesar said "ista quidem vis est" ("This is violence").[10][11] The Latin words Et tu, Brute?,
however, were not devised by Shakespeare for this play since they are attributed to Caesar in
earlier Elizabethan works and had become conventional by 1599.

Shakespeare deviated from these historical facts to curtail time and compress the facts so that the play
could be staged more easily. The tragic force is condensed into a few scenes for heightened effect.

Date and text

Julius  Caesar  was  originally  published  in  the  First  Folio  of  1623,
but a performance was mentioned by Thomas Platter the Younger
in  his  diary  in  September  1599.  The  play  is  not  mentioned  in  the
list  of  Shakespeare's  plays  published  by  Francis  Meres  in  1598.
Based  on  these  two  points,  as  well  as  several  contemporary
allusions,  and  the  belief  that  the  play  is  similar  to  Hamlet  in
vocabulary,  and  to  Henry  V  and  As  You  Like  It  in  metre,[12]
scholars have suggested 1599 as a probable date.[13]

The text of Julius Caesar in the First Folio is the only authoritative
text  for  the  play.  The  Folio  text  is  notable  for  its  quality  and
consistency;  scholars  judge  it  to  have  been  set  into  type  from  a
theatrical prompt-book.[14]

The  play  contains  many  anachronistic  elements  from  the
Elizabethan era. The characters mention objects such as doublets
(large,  heavy  jackets)  –  which  did  not  exist  in  ancient  Rome.
Caesar is mentioned to be wearing an Elizabethan doublet instead
of a Roman toga. At one point a clock is heard to strike and Brutus
notes it with "Count the clock".

Analysis and criticism

Historical background

The first page of Julius Caesar,
printed in the Second Folio of 1632

Maria  Wyke  has  written  that  the  play  reflects  the  general  anxiety  of  Elizabethan  England  over  a
succession of leadership. At the time of its creation and first performance, Queen Elizabeth, a strong
ruler, was elderly and had refused to name a successor, leading to worries that a civil war similar to
that of Rome might break out after her death.[15]

Protagonist debate

Critics  of  Shakespeare's  play  Julius  Caesar  differ  greatly  in  their  views  of  Caesar  and  Brutus.  Many
have debated whether Caesar or Brutus is the protagonist of the play. Intertwined in this debate is a
smattering  of  philosophical  and  psychological  ideologies  on  republicanism  and  monarchism.  One
author,  Robert  C.  Reynolds,  devotes  attention  to  the  names  or  epithets  given  to  both  Brutus  and
Caesar in his essay "Ironic Epithet in Julius Caesar". He points out that Casca praises Brutus at face
value,  but  then  inadvertently  compares  him  to  a  disreputable  joke  of  a  man  by  calling  him  an
alchemist, "Oh, he sits high in all the people's hearts,/And that which would appear offense in us/ His
countenance,  like  richest  alchemy,/  Will  change  to  virtue  and  worthiness"  (I.iii.158–160).  Reynolds

also talks about Caesar and his "Colossus" epithet, which he points
out  has  obvious  connotations  of  power  and  manliness,  but  also
lesser-known  connotations  of  an  outward  glorious  front  and
inward chaos.[16]

Myron  Taylor,  in  his  essay  "Shakespeare's  Julius  Caesar  and  the
Irony  of  History",  compares  the  logic  and  philosophies  of  Caesar
and  Brutus.  Caesar  is  deemed  an  intuitive  philosopher  who  is
always right when he goes with his instinct; for instance, when he
says  he  fears  Cassius  as  a  threat  to  him  before  he  is  killed,  his
intuition is correct. Brutus is portrayed as a man similar to Caesar,
but  whose  passions  lead  him  to  the  wrong  reasoning,  which  he
realizes  in  the  end  when  he  says  in  V.v.50–51,  "Caesar,  now  be
still:/ I killed not thee with half so good a will".[17]

Joseph W. Houppert acknowledges that some critics have tried to
cast  Caesar  as  the  protagonist,  but  that  ultimately  Brutus  is  the
driving force in the play and is, therefore, the tragic hero. Brutus
attempts to put the republic over his relationship with Caesar and
kills him. Brutus makes the political mistakes that bring down the republic that his ancestors created.
He  acts  on  his  passions,  does  not  gather  enough  evidence  to  make  reasonable  decisions,  and  is
manipulated by Cassius and the other conspirators.[18]

IV, Scene iii: Brutus sees Caesar's
ghost

Traditional readings of the play may maintain that Cassius and the other conspirators are motivated
largely by envy and ambition, whereas Brutus is motivated by the demands of honor and patriotism.
Certainly, this is the view that Antony expresses in the final scene. But one of the central strengths of
the  play  is  that  it  resists  categorizing  its  characters  as  either  simple  heroes  or  villains.  The  political
journalist  and  classicist  Garry  Wills  maintains  that  "This  play  is  distinctive  because  it  has  no
villains".[19]

It is a drama famous for the difficulty of deciding which role to emphasize. The characters
rotate  around  each  other  like  the  plates  of  a  Calder  mobile.  Touch  one  and  it  affects  the
position of all the others. Raise one, and another sinks. But they keep coming back into a
precarious balance.[20]

Performance history

The  play  was  probably  one  of  Shakespeare's  first  to  be  performed  at  the  Globe  Theatre.[21]  Thomas
Platter the Younger, a Swiss traveler, saw a tragedy about Julius Caesar at a Bankside theatre on 21
September  1599,  and  this  was  most  likely  Shakespeare's  play,  as  there  is  no  obvious  alternative
candidate. (While the story of Julius Caesar was dramatized repeatedly in the Elizabethan/Jacobean
period, none of the other plays known is as good a match with Platter's description as Shakespeare's
play.)[22]

After  the  theatres  re-opened  at  the  start  of  the  Restoration  era,  the  play  was  revived  by  Thomas
Killigrew's King's Company in 1672. Charles Hart initially played Brutus, as did Thomas Betterton in
later  productions.  Julius  Caesar  was  one  of  the  very  few  Shakespeare  plays  that  was  not  adapted
during the Restoration period or the eighteenth century.[23]

Notable performances

1864: Junius Jr., Edwin and John Wilkes Booth (later the
assassin of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln) made the only
appearance onstage together in a benefit performance of Julius
Caesar on 25 November 1864, at the Winter Garden Theater in
New York City. Junius Jr. played Cassius, Edwin played Brutus
and John Wilkes played Mark Antony. This landmark production
raised funds to erect a statue of Shakespeare in Central Park,
which remains to this day.
29 May 1916: A one-night performance in the natural bowl of
Beachwood Canyon, Hollywood drew an audience of 40,000 and
starred Tyrone Power Sr. and Douglas Fairbanks Sr. The student
bodies of Hollywood and Fairfax High Schools played opposing
armies, and the elaborate battle scenes were performed on a
huge stage as well as the surrounding hillsides. The play
commemorated the tercentenary of Shakespeare's death. A
photograph of the elaborate stage and viewing stands can be
seen on the Library of Congress website. The performance was
lauded by L. Frank Baum.[24]
1926: Another elaborate performance of the play was staged as a
benefit for the Actors Fund of America at the Hollywood Bowl.
Caesar arrived for the Lupercal in a chariot drawn by four white
horses. The stage was the size of a city block and dominated by a central tower 80 feet (24 m) in
height. The event was mainly aimed at creating work for unemployed actors. Three hundred
gladiators appeared in an arena scene not featured in Shakespeare's play; a similar number of
girls danced as Caesar's captives; a total of three thousand soldiers took part in the battle
sequences.

1937: Caesar, Orson Welles's famous Mercury Theatre production, drew fevered comment as the
director dressed his protagonists in uniforms reminiscent of those common at the time in Fascist
Italy and Nazi Germany, drawing a specific analogy between Caesar and Fascist Italian leader
Benito Mussolini. Time magazine gave the production a rave review,[25] together with the New
York critics.[26]: 313–319  The fulcrum of the show was the slaughter of Cinna the Poet (Norman
Lloyd), a scene that stopped the show.[27] Caesar opened at the Mercury Theatre in New York City
in November 1937[28]: 339  and moved to the larger National Theater in January 1938,[28]: 341
running a total of 157 performances.[29] A second company made a five-month national tour with
Caesar in 1938, again to critical acclaim.[30]: 357
1950: John Gielgud played Cassius at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre under the direction of
Michael Langham and Anthony Quayle. The production was considered one of the highlights of a
remarkable Stratford season and led to Gielgud (who had done little film work to that time) playing
Cassius in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1953 film version.
1977: Gielgud made his final appearance in a Shakespearean role on stage as Caesar in John
Schlesinger's production at the Royal National Theatre. The cast also included Ian Charleson as
Octavius.

1994: Arvind Gaur directed the play in India with Jaimini Kumar
as Brutus and Deepak Ochani as Caesar (24 shows); later on he
revived it with Manu Rishi as Caesar and Vishnu Prasad as
Brutus for the Shakespeare Drama Festival, Assam in 1998.
Arvind Kumar translated Julius Caesar into Hindi. This production
was also performed at the Prithvi international theatre festival, at
the India Habitat Centre, New Delhi.
2005: Denzel Washington played Brutus in the first Broadway
production of the play in over fifty years. The production received
universally negative reviews but was a sell-out because of
Washington's popularity at the box office.[31]
2012: The Royal Shakespeare Company staged an all-black
production under the direction of Gregory Doran.
2012: An all-female production starring Harriet Walter as Brutus
and Frances Barber as Caesar was staged at the Donmar
Warehouse, directed by Phyllida Lloyd. In October 2013, the
production transferred to New York's St. Ann's Warehouse in
Brooklyn.
2018: The Bridge Theatre staged Julius Caesar as one of its first
productions, under the direction of Nicholas Hytner, with Ben Whishaw, Michelle Fairley, and
David Morrissey as leads. This mirrors the play's status as one of the first productions at the
Globe Theatre in 1599.

Adaptations and cultural references

One  of  the  earliest  cultural  references  to  the  play  came  in
Shakespeare's own Hamlet. Prince Hamlet asks Polonius about his
career  as  a  thespian  at  university,  and  Polonius  replies:  "I  did
enact Julius Caesar. I was killed in the Capitol. Brutus killed me."
This  is  a  likely  meta-reference,  as  Richard  Burbage  is  generally
accepted to have played leading men Brutus and Hamlet, and the
older John Heminges to have played Caesar and Polonius.

In 1851, the German composer Robert Schumann wrote a concert
overture  Julius  Caesar,  inspired  by  Shakespeare's  play.  Other
musical  settings  include  those  by  Giovanni  Bononcini,  Hans  von
Bülow,  Felix  Draeseke,  Josef  Bohuslav  Foerster,  John  Ireland,
John  Foulds,  Gian  Francesco  Malipiero,  Manfred  Gurlitt,  Darius  Milhaud,  and  Mario  Castelnuovo-
Tedesco.[32]

1963 production of Julius Caesar at
The Doon School, India.

The Canadian comedy duo Wayne and Shuster parodied Julius Caesar in their 1958 sketch Rinse the
Blood off My Toga. Flavius Maximus, Private Roman Eye, is hired by Brutus to investigate the death
of Caesar. The police procedural combines Shakespeare, Dragnet, and vaudeville jokes and was first
broadcast on The Ed Sullivan Show.[33]

In  1984,  the  Riverside  Shakespeare  Company  of  New  York  City  produced  a  modern  dress  Julius
Caesar  set  in  contemporary  Washington,  called  simply  CAESAR!,  starring  Harold  Scott  as  Brutus,
Herman  Petras  as  Caesar,  Marya  Lowry  as  Portia,  Robert  Walsh  as  Antony,  and  Michael  Cook  as

Cassius, directed by W. Stuart McDowell at The Shakespeare Center.[34]

In  2006,  Chris  Taylor  from  the  Australian  comedy  team  The  Chaser  wrote  a  comedy  musical  called
Dead Caesar which was shown at the Sydney Theatre Company in Sydney.[35]

The  line  "The  Evil  That  Men  Do",  from  the  speech  made  by  Mark  Antony  following  Caesar's  death
("The  evil  that  men  do  lives  after  them;  The  good  is  oft  interred  with  their  bones.")  has  had  many
references in media, including the titles of:

A song by Iron Maiden.
A politically oriented film directed by J. Lee Thompson in 1984.
A novel in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series.

The  2008  movie  Me  and  Orson  Welles,  based  on  a  book  of  the  same  name  by  Robert  Kaplow,  is  a
fictional story centered around Orson Welles' famous 1937 production of Julius Caesar at the Mercury
Theatre.  British  actor  Christian  McKay  is  cast  as  Welles,  and  co-stars  with  Zac  Efron  and  Claire
Danes.

The  2012  Italian  drama  film  Caesar  Must  Die  (Italian:  Cesare  deve  morire),  directed  by  Paolo  and
Vittorio Taviani, follows convicts in their rehearsals ahead of a prison performance of Julius Caesar.

In the Ray Bradbury book Fahrenheit 451, some of the character Beatty's last words are "There is no
terror, Cassius, in your threats, for I am armed so strong in honesty that they pass me as an idle wind,
which I respect not!"

The play's line "the fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves", spoken by Cassius in Act I,
scene  2,  is  often  referenced  in  popular  culture.  The  line  gave  its  name  to  the  J.M.  Barrie  play  Dear
Brutus, and also gave its name to the best-selling young adult novel The Fault in Our Stars by John
Green  and  its  film  adaptation.  The  same  line  was  quoted  in  Edward  R.  Murrow's  epilogue  of  his
famous 1954 See It Now documentary broadcast concerning Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. This speech
and  the  line  were  recreated  in  the  2005  film  Good  Night,  and  Good  Luck.  It  was  also  quoted  by
George Clooney's character in the Coen brothers film Intolerable Cruelty.

The  line  "And  therefore  think  him  as  a  serpent's  egg  /  Which  hatched,  would,  as  his  kind  grow
mischievous; And kill him in the shell" spoken by Brutus in Act II, Scene 1, is referenced in the Dead
Kennedys song "California über alles".

The title of Agatha Christie's novel Taken at the Flood, titled There Is a Tide in its American edition,
refers to an iconic line of Brutus: "There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads
on to fortune." (Act IV, Scene III).

The line "There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted,
all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat.
And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures" is recited by Jean-Luc Picard at the
end of the Star Trek: Picard series finale, "The Last Generation." The play was previously discussed in
a  conversation  between  Julian  Bashir  and  Elim  Garak  in  the  Star  Trek:  Deep  Space  Nine  episode
"Improbable Cause".

Film and television adaptations

Julius Caesar has been adapted to a number of film productions, including:

Julius Caesar (Vitagraph Company of America, 1908), produced by J. Stuart Blackton and
directed by William V. Ranous, who also played Antony.[36]
Julius Caesar (Avon Productions, 1950), directed by David Bradley, who played Brutus; Charlton
Heston played Antony and Harold Tasker played Caesar.[37]
Julius Caesar (MGM, 1953), directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and produced by John Houseman;
starring James Mason as Brutus, Marlon Brando as Antony and Louis Calhern as Caesar.[37]
An Honourable Murder (1960), directed by Godfrey Grayson;[38] depicted the play in a modern
business setting.[39]
The Spread of the Eagle, a 1963 BBC series comprising Coriolanus, Julius Caesar, and Antony &
Cleopatra.
Julius Caesar (BBC, 1969), a television adaptation in the Play of the Month series, directed by
Alan Bridges.
Julius Caesar (Commonwealth United, 1969), directed by Stuart Burge, produced by Peter Snell,
starring Jason Robards as Brutus, Charlton Heston as Antony and John Gielgud as Caesar.[37]
Heil Caesar (BBC, 1973), a three-part television play written by John Griffith Bowen that was "a
modern-dress modern-dialogue rewrite of the play, updated to an unnamed present-day regime
that's about to switch from democracy to dictatorship unless Brutus and his conspirators act to
prevent it." It was intended as an introduction to Shakespeare's play for schoolchildren, but it
proved good enough to be shown on adult television, and a stage version was later produced.[40]
The British Universities Film & Video Council database states that the work "transforms the play
into a modern political conspiracy thriller with modern dialogue and many strong allusions to
political events in the early 1970."[41]
Julius Caesar (BBC/Time-Life TV, 1978), a television adaptation in the BBC Television
Shakespeare series, directed by Herbert Wise and produced by Cedric Messina, starring Richard
Pasco as Brutus, Keith Michell as Antony and Charles Gray as Caesar.[37]
Julius Caesar (2010), is a short film starring Randy Harrison as Brutus and John Shea as Julius
Caesar. Directed by Patrick J Donnelly and produced by Dan O'Hare.[42]
Caesar Must Die (2012), is an Italian film about a group of prison inmates rehearsing a play.
Ultimately, the prison life and the play become indistinguishable and Mark Antony's Friends,
Romans... speech is delivered in a prison courtyard with hundreds of prisoners peeking from their
cell windows taking the role of Roman citizens. While the film is fictional, the actors are actual
prison inmates playing themselves.[43]
Julius Caesar (2012), a BBC television film adaptation of the Royal Shakespeare Company stage
production of the same year directed by Gregory Doran with an all-Black cast, sets the tragedy in
post-independence Africa with echoes of the Arab Spring. The film stars Paterson Joseph as
Brutus, Ray Fearon as Antony, Jeffery Kissoon as Caesar, Cyril Nri as Cassius and Adjoa Andoh
as Portia.[44]
Zulfiqar (2016), a Bengali-language Indian film by Srijit Mukherji that is an adaptation of both
Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra and a tribute to the film The Godfather.[45]

Contemporary political references
Modern  adaptions  of  the  play  have  often  made  contemporary  political  references,[46]  with  Caesar
depicted  as  resembling  a  variety  of  political  leaders,  including  Huey  Long,  Margaret  Thatcher,  and
Tony Blair,[47] as well as Fidel Castro and Oliver North.[48][49] Scholar A. J. Hartley stated that this is

a fairly "common trope" of Julius Caesar performances: "Throughout the 20th century and into the
21st, the rule has been to create a recognizable political world within the production. And often people
in  the  title  role  itself  look  like  or  feel  like  somebody  either  in  recent  or  current  politics."[47]  A  2012
production of Julius Caesar by the Guthrie Theater and The Acting Company "presented Caesar in the
guise  of  a  black  actor  who  was  meant  to  suggest  President  Obama."[46]  This  production  was  not
particularly controversial.[46]

In 2017, however, a modern adaptation of the play at New York's Shakespeare in the Park (performed
by  The  Public  Theater)  depicted  Caesar  with  the  likeness  of  then-president  Donald  Trump  and
thereby  aroused  ferocious  controversy,  drawing  criticism  by  media  outlets  such  as  The  Daily  Caller
and  Breitbart  and  prompting  corporate  sponsors  Bank  of  America  and  Delta  Air  Lines  to  pull  their
financial  support.[46][50][51][52]  The  Public  Theater  stated  that  the  message  of  the  play  is  not  pro-
assassination  and  that  the  point  is  that  "those  who  attempt  to  defend  democracy  by  undemocratic
means pay a terrible price and destroy the very thing they are fighting to save." Shakespeare scholars
Stephen Greenblatt[53] and Peter Holland agreed with this statement.[47] Pallotta stated that "I have
never read anyone suggesting that 'Julius Caesar' is a play that recommends assassination. Look what
happens:  Caesar  is  assassinated  to  stop  him  from  becoming  a  dictator.  Result:  civil  war,  massive
slaughter, creation of an emperor, execution of many who sympathized with the conspiracy. Doesn't
look  much  like  a  successful  result  for  the  conspirators  to  me."[47]  The  play  was  interrupted  several
times  by  right-wing  protesters,  who  accused  the  play  of  "violence  against  the  right",  and  actors  and
members  of  theatres  with  Shakespeare  in  the  name  were  harassed  and  received  death  threats,
including  the  wife  of  the  play's  director  Oskar  Eustis.[54][55][56][57]  The  protests  were  praised  by
American  Family  Association  director  Sandy  Rios  who  compared  the  play  with  the  execution  of
Christians by damnatio ad bestias.[58]

The 2018 Bridge Theatre production also incorporates modern political imagery. The commoners in
the  first  scene  sing  modern  punk  music  and  Caesar  distributes  red  hats  to  the  audience  that  are
remarkably similar to Donald Trump's campaign merchandise.[59] The conspirators also use modern
firearms during the assassination and the Battle of Phillipi.[59]
